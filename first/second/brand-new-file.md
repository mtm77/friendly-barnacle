Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, this is a brand new file and I'm really liking it. The line length is 80 characters, so I feel like it's a pretty good line length for a lot of the things I want to do, from writing functions to writing more functions.

```js
function Thisn () {
  console.log("NICE")
}
```

Anyway, I think that the console log for this kind of stuff is pretty nice. Don't you think? Wouldn't you agree? I really like how it works.

Anyway, a long time ago, lorem ipsum.
