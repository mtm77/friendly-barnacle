title: My 2021 setup tour
---

This is a review of my ever-evolving office setup, and by continuing, you agree not to make fun of me for caring about really small details. I'm really particular when it comes to my desk setup, probably more particular than any other part of my life!

## MacBook Pro

Rating: 7/10

Not the best computer I've ever owned; it's had issues with the keyboard, battery, and screen. Apple was generous enough to do a full body replacement for free. It's not very fast either. I'd like to upgrade this to the M1 eventually, which I hear is wonderful.

I also have a ___ docking station.

## Leopold FC660 (Silent)

Rating: 8/10

This is a Topre keyboard, and it [sounds like rain](#). I use a desk mat to dampen the sound a bit more, otherwise it's louder than I would like. I like the smaller form factor but would probably prefer a tenkeyless a bit more. Because I use it with a Mac, I miss out on having some of the function keys – like Play/Pause, Previous/Next Song, and volume keys – unless I install something like Karabiner.

I'm coming from Cherry MX Blues, and the feel of Topre was a bit underwhelming at first, until I realized that I didn't need to press as hard. Once you realize that you need to type with softer presses, the feel is wonderful, and you can tell the keyboard is high quality. I still change back to MX Blues or my Apple Magic Keyboard (sacrilege!) every once in a while, but I always gravitate back to Topre.

One of the things I miss the most is having the tilde (`\``) key above tab. I used Karabiner to remap Insert to it. I also remapped Caps Lock to act as a ??? key, so I can hold down Caps Lock and use QWEASD to control media playback and volume.

My other two keyboards were a Pok3r and Das Keyboard 4(?), with MX Blues. I've used both for years, and realized that I like having dedicated arrow keys, although I don't use the numpad.

Also, typing my post with this is freaking amazing. I've heard Topre described as "typing on bubble wrap" or "typing on the surface of water". I think I agree with "typing on the surface of water" the most – it feels like a membrane keyboard done right. The Leopold is especially sturdy and well-built.

## MX Master

Rating: 9/10

Probably the perfect mouse. I've had this thing for years and it's never broken. As soon as it breaks, I'll get another one. It's super comfortable to hold and looks great.

I also have a Magic Trackpad, which I also love, but I think the MX Master is slightly faster/more accurate. I also love that I can remap its buttons. I use it to control the volume, open Mission Control, and play/pause media.

My only complaint is that the scrolling doesn't feel quite as nice as the Magic Trackpad's – the wheel is a little choppy and sensitive, on both smooth and clicky modes.

## Dell Monitor U2720Q

Rating: 5/10

This has a USB-C hub on the back of it, which I connect to my keyboard and microphone. It connects to my MacBook Pro with one USB-C cable, and also charges it. I love that it's a one-cord setup and doesn't need a dongle.

Why's the rating so low? About 25% of the time, any devices connected via the USB hub won't connect. You can see that they're receiving power (their LEDs will come on). It's [this problem](#). I have to unplug + replug the USB-C cable until it works, which can take a couple minutes. It's just really frustrating.

Dell also proclaims that they don't test their monitors on Apple products, and so it's not clear if this is Apple's fault or Dell's.

The second reason the rating is so low is that this thing is kinda ugly compared to Apple's old Thunderbolt monitor.

## Ikea Lamp

Rating: 9/10

This provides a warm light for working at night and has a charging station built into the base that works with my iPhone and AirPods Pro. It's built surprisingly well – I can turn it and make the light face different directions, and it feels solid. Definitely a step up from the normal desk lamp.

It also has a USB port built into the base.

## Ikea Gerton (Birch?) w/ Adils Legs

Rating: 8/10

I love the look of this, and that the Adils legs are adjustable, so I can put the desk at a comfortable height. (Note that you need to turn the desk over to do this – it isn't something you adjust throughout the day.)

The top is beautiful. I need to sand it every once in a while to keep it looking good. People also say that you should finish it with something like Behandla oil to prevent water stains, but I love the soft, natural look (and feel) of the wood.

I just use a few coasters from IKEA so I don't stain the wood.

## Hydro Flask

Rating: 10/10

I didn't think I'd like this as much as I do, but I freaking love it. It holds 8 cups of liquid and keeps it cool throughout the day. I got the sipping lid which makes it easy to hold. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to drink more water, especially if you're taking something like creatine or a medicine which makes you thirsty.

## Blue Yeti w/ pop filter

Rating: 8/10

I wanted a microphone after having some problems with my AirPods during a really important call for work. I wanted a USB microphone because I didn't need the quality that comes with an XLR (?) mic, I just wanted something reliable for Zoom. The runner-up was the Audio-Technica AT2020, but I liked that the Blue Yeti came with a nice stand and looked good.

I use it in cardioid mode, which makes my voice sound incredible. Here's a comparison between AirPods Pro and the Blue Yeti:

...
...

The cons: it's _really_ sensitive, so it picks up everything – like a plate clanking from across the house. The other is a design critique: when mute is off, it displays a red LED. When mute is on, it blinks the red LED. I think it would look nicer if the LED was off when mute was off, and was solid red when mute was on.

But I love that this thing can plug into a USB port and make my voice sound that good. I got a lot of compliments on conference calls after I switched away from AirPods!

I thought the silver would look good with my desk, but I probably should've bought it in black.

## Logitech Stream Pro Whatever

Rating: 10/10

Crystal clear with a really nice design. With the MX Master and this webcam, have I been sleeping on Logitech? The only thing better would be a webcam directly inside the monitor, or maybe a camera to get that nice blurred effect.

## AirPods Pro

Rating: 7/10

When they work, they're awesome. I love the noise cancelling mode (absolutely incredible for relaxing after a stressful day), and they're decent for conference calls. I like that I can walk around while wearing them. There's definitely a benefit to having a wireless setup, and I get where Apple is going with it. Spatial audio is freaking insane. The case is really pretty. I connect them to 2-3 different devices throughout the day, and rarely have problems doing it – they're really smart!

The cons: I wish the battery life was a bit longer, and they're uncomfortable if you wear them for more than an hour or so. I've also had to factory reset them twice because the audio input will sometimes completely fail, making me unintelligible (people say I sound like a digitized apache helicopter). Not sure if this is my computer or AirPods.

## Audio Technica Headphones

Rating: 8/10

Really solid headphones. I've had them for years. I needed to get new ear cups and a band to cover the top because they were falling apart, but the sound is really good and they're comfortable, even after wearing them for hours.

## Poang w/ Blanket

Rating: 6/10

Love the look, but for some reason, mine feels really stiff. It's not as comfortable as the one at the Ikea store. Maybe it needs broken in?

The headrest sits too far forward and makes my neck hurt, but if I take it off, it's pretty nice (although it looks ridiculous like this):

![](#)

> I'll probably end up modding it to take off the headrest entirely.

There are lots of pretty colors!

## Herman Miller Aeron

Rating: 10/10

The best chair. I bought this a few years ago. It's a used Aeron from 2002 (!), and I found it on Ebay for about $400 total. It's built like a tank and I love it. I've had some posture and upper back problems, and this thing made them mostly vanish.

There are a few parts of it that are a little wobbly, but I think that's understandable for its age. I'm definitely getting another Herman Miller chair in the next few years, probably another Aeron or a [the cool-spined one], which is pretty sweet-looking:

![](#)

This is definitely an office chair, so it's not made for relaxing. Sometimes I wish I could kick my feet up in it because it's so comfortable.

## Moleskine w/ Graph Paper, plus pen/pencil

Rating: 9/10

An all-around good notebook. I like using it for brainstorming approaches to code and sketching UI states. Only knocked off a point because the paper is a little thin.

I'll usually use a graphing pencil (this one) or a Pilot pen.

## Recommendations

If you're upgrading your setup, don't buy everything all at once! I had a completely different setup that I modeled after things on /r/battlestations, and it's probably one of my bigger "setup" regrets.

If you want to make a setup that works for _you_, I think it's really important to start small and only buy things when you're feeling the pain of not having them. For instance, my very first setup had a cheap refurbished monitor with dead pixels, an uncomfortable glass desk from WalMart, a Dell membrane keyboard, and a $10 mouse from Amazon. Over the years, I slowly replaced and upgraded things.

Take buying an XLR mic, for example. If you get one of those, you'll need to get a [power bank adapter thingy?] and an arm, and then you'll probably have enough stuff to need a power strip and a cable management system. The extra stuff takes up desk space, so you decide to get a monitor shelf to _hold_ the stuff, and then you need to _fill out_ the shelf with _more_ stuff... so you wind up with an expensive, inflexible space where you only use half of your things.

My mindset on building this setup was to have a nice-looking setup where everything _just works_. I tried to keep my desk as free from clutter as possible, because it gives me a nice working space when I _do_ need the space (like if I bring out the MIDI keyboard!).

For inspiration, I like /r/macsetups and /r/battlestations.
